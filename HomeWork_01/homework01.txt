Exercise 1:
Create a zoo (of some sorts)

Have a common ancestor class: animal

Each animal should have a name

Have a three other classes that extend that class (zebra, elephant, python)

Implement the makesound feature that we have seen on the slide.

The animals should have their own methods and variables (use your imagination)

Create an interface called hasLegs with a letsRun method and a getNumberOfLegs method and then implement that interface for the animals that have legs.

Create a common array for the animals



Exercice 2 :
Write a program that takes a number from standard input and displays it. For this, we will use an
object (an instance) of the Scanner class and particularly its nextInt() method.

Exercice 3 :
Modify the previous program so that it reads from the keyboard a series of positive or zero real
numbers (corresponding to notes), ending in the value -1, and calculates the Olympic average of
these values, i.e. the average of the scores regardless of the highest or lowest score.
